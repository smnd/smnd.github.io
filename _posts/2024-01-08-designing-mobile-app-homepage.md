summary: The home page matters most; keep it fresh or users stop expecting anything new and drop off. Match the app’s job - exploration apps can lean on novelty, while need-based should prioritize core actions over filler content.

In mobile apps, the home page is the most important property. It’s the first and most frequent touchpoint. The hard part is keeping it relevant and fresh. If people see the same content every time, they stop expecting anything new and drop off.

But it isn’t black and white. It depends on the nature of the app. Apps that invite exploration have it easier. Apps whose job is to drive actions (eg. transactions) must focus on actions.

Social and e-commerce apps can lean on user-generated content, recommendations, curation, and merchandising. These aren’t trivial, but the path is clear.

Need-based apps, like payments and travel, don’t naturally create new content. The home page must first satisfy the primary need(s). So, actions come first.

There’s often an internal push to make these home pages “engaging” with deals and offers or other force-fits. But that content rarely causes action. It becomes filler and pulls focus from what matters.

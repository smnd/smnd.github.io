Too much info causes decision fatigue. It kills clicks—especially on home screens. Show only the few signals that drive choice. Push the rest one tap deeper. For a deal card, show price; hide location or rating unless they truly matter.

If you want exploration, add novelty. Rotate content. If the page never changes, people stop visiting. You teach them not to expect anything new. [Not every app can refresh often](designing-mobile-app-homepage), and that’s fine—pick a cadence you can keep.

Add visual breaks. Long runs of similar cards tire the eye. Mix layouts or content types to reset attention.

Use those breaks as gentle guides. Add small prompts that steer people with little effort—for example, show filters after a few scrolls.

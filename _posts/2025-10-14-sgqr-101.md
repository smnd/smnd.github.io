summary: A simple expalanation of how SGQR works. What it is. And what it is not. SGQR is a single, standard QR label that bundles multiple scheme payloads; it’s not a payment rail or interoperability layer. Which apps work depends on the merchant’s acquirer(s) and the payloads added, so acceptance varies—even though the sticker is one.

## What is SGQR?

SGQR is a **standardised QR code format** for payments in Singapore. Think of it as a universal QR "language" that different payment apps can read.

It's **not** a payment network, **not** a switch, and **does not** create interoperability between schemes. It's just a standardised format.

## What Problem Does It Solve?

Before SGQR, merchants had to display multiple QR codes - one for each payment provider. Now they can display just one QR code that works with multiple apps reducing clutter and making acceptance simpler.

That's it. That was the only problem SGQR was designed to solve.

## Can I Use Any App to Pay?

No, and this is where the confusion starts.

Just because a merchant displays an SGQR code doesn't mean every app can pay to it. **You can only pay if your app's provider has signed up that merchant.**

For example: If only Fave has signed up a merchant, only Fave users can pay - even though the QR code follows the SGQR standard that Grab and PayLah! can read.

## How Does This Work?

Think of SGQR as a **folder** on the counter. Each scheme places its **own file** (payload) in the folder. Your app opens the folder and looks for **its file**. If it’s there, you can pay. If not, you can’t.

When you scan an SGQR code, your app looks for its specific payment information inside. If it's not there, you can't pay - even though your app can successfully scan the code.

## Technical Note

While the SGQR format is standardized, each provider's payment data inside is different. Some use URLs (like Fave), others use unique IDs (like Grab). This is by design - SGQR standardises the container, not the contents.

- Fave: URL (e.g., `https://myfave.com/qr/...`)
- Alipay: URL (e.g., `https://qr.alipay.com/...`)
- Grab: UUID (e.g., `101fee38-ffde-429d-b723-d14c9772af54`)

## Is there Any Interoperability at All?

Only where there’s a **commercial/technical tie-up** between schemes/acquirers. SGQR itself doesn’t provide it (yet). For example, what Fave has with DBS Paylah!, Google Pay, UOB and Singtel Dash. Each of these apps can read the Fave payload and process a payment from customers using their apps.

<!-- ## Paper QR Payment Notifications -->

<!-- In the context of SG POS, the terminal can show notifications only for payments made via Fave (or our partner apps). Payments made with other apps aren’t visible to us, so the experience will be inconsistent. -->

# App metadata (final)

**App Name (≤30):**  
NiftyScan

**Subtitle (≤30):**  
Fast, private code scanning

**Promotional Text (≤170):**  
Scan QR & barcodes fast. Parse payment codes (SGQR/PayNow, DuitNow, UPI). History stays on your iPhone. Pro unlocks unlimited history, App Lock, pinning.

**Description (store text):**  
NiftyScan reads any QR or barcode in a snap—and keeps your data on your iPhone. It also parses supported payment QR codes (SGQR/PayNow, DuitNow, UPI) to show the embedded fields in plain English, so you can quickly verify what you’re scanning. No accounts. No tracking. No analytics.

WHAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT  
• Private by design: All scans and history stay on device  
• Payment QR parsing: Human-readable fields for SGQR/PayNow, DuitNow, UPI  
• Clean history: Search, copy, share; clear anytime  
• Pro tools: Unlimited history, App Lock (Face ID/Touch ID), Pin scans protected during bulk clear

HOW IT WORKS

1. Open and point the camera—auto-detects QR & barcodes
    
2. See raw data and, when applicable, a readable payment breakdown
    
3. Tap to copy or share
    
4. Manage history; with Pro you can pin and lock
    

WHO IT’S FOR  
• Shoppers and power users who want a fast scanner without data leaving their phone  
• Small businesses verifying payment QR contents  
• Anyone who values speed, clarity, and privacy

PRO MODE (ONE-TIME PURCHASE)  
• Unlimited history  
• App Lock (Face ID/Touch ID)  
• Pin scans (kept during bulk clear)

PRIVACY  
• No cloud sync (yet). No tracking. No analytics.  
• Data is stored locally on your device.  
This app does not process payments; it only reads code contents. Brand names mentioned are for compatibility and identification only.

## Notes & next steps

- Price: pick the Apple tier closest to **SGD 20** for the Pro IAP.
    
- Keep “payment parsing” to only **SGQR/PayNow, DuitNow, UPI** in copy and screenshots (no other brands).
    
- If you add iCloud sync later, update the description and privacy label.

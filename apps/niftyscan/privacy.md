# NiftyScan / Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** 01 November 2025  
**Contact:** [niftyscan@hypothetical.ink](mailto:niftyscan@hypothetical.ink)

## Summary

- **No cloud sync, no tracking, no analytics.**
- **Scans & history stay on your device.**
- **Pro is a one-time Apple purchase; we don’t see your card/billing details.**
- **You can clear history in-app; pinned scans (Pro) survive bulk delete (and can be deleted individually).**

## Data the App handles

- **Scan content & history:** Decoded data and your history list are stored **only on your device**.
- **Settings & Pro status:** App preferences (e.g., **app lock**) and Pro entitlement state stored locally.
- **Biometrics (optional):** If you enable app lock, Face ID/Touch ID is used by iOS for authentication. We do **not** access or store biometric data.
- **Backups:** iOS device backups (e.g., iCloud/iTunes) may include App data; those backups are controlled by you/Apple.

## Data we do **not** collect

We do not collect or store your scan contents, analytics, advertising identifiers, location, contacts, or other telemetry on our servers. We do not include ad/analytics SDKs.

## Purchases

Payments are processed by Apple. We receive only the receipt information required to unlock **Pro**. Card/billing details are handled by Apple and are not shared with us. **Refunds follow Apple’s policies.** Request refunds via Apple’s **[Report a Problem](https://support.apple.com/en-us/118223)** site using your Apple ID.

## Sharing & Disclosure

We do not sell or share personal data. We may disclose information if required by law or to protect rights/safety.

## Security

Your data remains on your device and benefits from iOS safeguards (device encryption; Secure Enclave for biometrics). No method is 100% secure – use a device passcode and keep iOS updated.

## Your choices & controls

- **Clear history:** Use the in-app control to delete history. **Pinned scans (Pro) are retained on bulk delete** and can be removed individually.
- **Delete everything:** Delete the App (and, if desired, remove device backups).
- **Permissions:** Control camera access in iOS Settings.

## Children

The App is **not directed to children under 13**. If local law requires a higher minimum age, that higher age applies.

## International availability

This is a **single global policy**. If you email us for support, any info you voluntarily provide may be processed where I operate.

## Changes

We may update this Policy. Material changes will be reflected by updating the effective date and, where required, via in-app notice.

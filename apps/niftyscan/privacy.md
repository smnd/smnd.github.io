## niftyscan - Privacy Policy

### Summary

**QR Scan** is designed to work **on-device**. No account is required, and scanning happens locally. You control what is saved or shared.

### Information We Handle

- **Scan Content:** Detected code data (e.g., URLs, payment QRs, Wi-Fi credentials) is processed **on your device** to show results and actions.  
- **History (Optional):** You can save scans to your device and delete them anytime.  
- **iCloud Sync (Optional):** If enabled in iOS settings, Apple may sync your history across devices under Appleâ€™s terms. We do not receive this data.  
- **Crash/Diagnostics (Optional):** If you opt in, we may receive anonymized crash logs or diagnostics via Apple. These do not include scan content.

We do **not** collect any data. No data ever leaves your device. We do **not** use scans for advertising.

### Permissions

- **Camera:** Required for live scanning.  
- **Photos (Optional):** If you choose to scan from an image, the App accesses only the image you select.

### Sharing

The app does not collect any data. Period. There is nothing to share with anyone unless you choose to share.

### Data Retention & Control

- **On-device:** History stays on your device unless you delete it or enable iCloud.  
- **iCloud:** Managed by Apple under your iCloud settings.  
- **Diagnostics:** Retained only as long as necessary for troubleshooting and improving the App.

You can delete history in the App, revoke camera/photos access in **Settings**, and disable iCloud sync at any time.

### Security

We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect information processed by the App. No method is 100% secure.

### Children

The App is not directed to children under **13** (or the age required by local law). If you believe a child has provided data, contact us to delete it.

### International Use

Your use may involve services provided by Apple or others outside your country. Their processing is governed by their terms and privacy policies.

### Changes

We may update this Policy. Material changes will be reflected by updating the **Effective date** and, where required, additional notice.

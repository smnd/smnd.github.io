## 1) Scope

**[App Name]** (the “App”) scans QR codes and barcodes on iOS, shows the decoded data, and keeps an **on-device** history. Some codes (e.g., complex payment QR) are **parsed for readability**. There is **no cloud sync**, **no tracking**, and **no analytics**. An optional one-time **Pro** purchase unlocks **unlimited history, app lock, and pinning**.

## 2) Agreement

By installing or using the App, you agree to these Terms and our **Privacy Policy**. If you do not agree, do not use the App.

Use the App only where lawful and **not while driving** or in unsafe conditions. You must have legal capacity to contract.

## 4) License

We grant you a personal, revocable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to use the App on Apple devices you own/control under Apple’s terms.

## 5) How the App works

- **Local only:** Scan contents and history stay on your device.
    
- **Parsing is informational:** Reformatted/parsed views are for convenience and **not financial, legal, or compliance advice**.
    
- **Not a payment processor:** The App does not initiate, process, or guarantee payments.

## 6) Acceptable use

Do not use the App unlawfully, to scan/store data you have no right to, to reverse engineer, or to interfere with security or operation.

## 10) Updates & changes

We may update the App or these Terms. Continued use after updates means you accept the changes.

## 11) Termination

We may suspend or terminate your use for violations or where required by law. You may stop using and delete the App at any time.

## Scope

**NiftyScan** (the “App”) scans QR codes and barcodes on iOS, shows the decoded data, and keeps an **on-device** history. Some codes (e.g., complex payment QR) are **parsed for readability**. There is **no cloud sync**, **no tracking**, and **no analytics**. An optional one-time **Pro** purchase unlocks **unlimited history, app lock, and pinning**.

## How the App works

- **Local only:** Scan contents and history stay on your device.
- **Parsing is informational:** Reformatted/parsed views are for convenience and **not financial, legal, or compliance advice**.
